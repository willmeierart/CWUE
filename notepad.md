  [] (once deployed to staging) start using google tools to be checking:
    [] pagespeed
    [] seo indexing
  [x] go thru wireframes and gcms and make sure model is correct
  [] **set up error boundaries for apollo (and maps, anything else that causes hard crash)...**
  [] once we enter design phase
    [] start mocking up according to spec
    [] work out top nav
  [] *implement custom < Head /> for every page for SEO*

- locations
  [] maps
    [] markers
      [] not rendering first SSR load? (or even the map now...)
      [] should never appear on initial map view
    [] not zooming/centering properly
      [] ...if previous marker contained within new markers...?
  [] regions page...?
  [] make sure imperative routing actually working how you want with redirects (should never show blank results page)
  [] make sure flow working with valid user location

- washes
  [] is every view really all that different?

- fastpass
  [] any guidance at all...

+ bottom logos aren't links to other sites
+ services:
  + (ask monte for list)
+ special: text/img ONLY 
+ location detail bottom blurb is maybe a testimonial / some statement
+ locations now need to have an individual prices thing (maybe that goes under washes in gcms)
  + also individual fast-passes?
+ there are multiple fastpasses? >> maybe not now
+ testimonial feedback needs to send email directly to email address
